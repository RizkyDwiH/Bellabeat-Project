## 1. Insight from daily activity trends (step count) and daily calories burned

### 1. Daily Activity Trends

• Step counts fluctuate over time, with some days showing high activity (8,200 steps) and others with low activity (3,400 steps) on May 9.

• Significant drop on April 17 (6,409 steps) and May 12 (3,482 steps), which may indicate less engagement, fatigue, or external factors (weather, etc)

• Highest step count was on May 5 (8,731 steps), showing peak activity on some days.

### 2. Daily Calories Burned

• Monday has the highest average calorie burn (3,406 kcal), suggesting users are more active at the start of the week.

• Friday has the lowest calorie burn (2,299 kcal), possibly indicating fatigue or reduced activity toward the weekend.

• Weekends (Sunday: 2,577 kcal, Saturday: 2,448 kcal) have slightly higher calories burned than midweek (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday).

### 3. Correlation Between Steps & Calories Burned:

• Some days may have high step counts but lower calorie burn, indicating low-intensity activity (e.g., walking vs. running).

• The decline in activity towards the end of the week may result in lower calories burned on Fridays.

## 2. Insight from Tracking Daily Heart Rate Trends (April - May 2016) and Weekly Steps Overview

### 1. Daily Heart Rate Trends

• The average heart rate fluctuates between 69.25 BPM and 82.82 BPM over time.

• Hight heart rate of 82.82 BPM happens around mid-April.

• Lowest heart rate of 69.25 BPM is recorded in early May.

### 2. Weekly Steps Overview

• Tuesday has the highest average steps (9,022 steps), followed by Monday (8,653 steps) and Saturday (8,639 steps).

• Sunday has the lowest step count (6,600 steps), indicating reduced activity on weekends.

• Steps are relatively high on weekdays, suggesting a more active routine during workdays.

### 3. Correlation Between Heart Rate & Steps

• The peak heart rate (82.82 BPM) aligns with active days, likely when step count is high.

• On lower step days, heart rate tends to drop, possibly due to less physical exertion or more rest.

• The variations in heart rate suggest different intensity levels—walking may have lower impact than running.

## 3. Insight from Average Sleep Duration per Day of the Week and Bellabeat Users: Hourly Step Activity Trends

### 1. Average Sleep Duration per Day of the Week

• Sunday has the highest sleep duration (7.25 hours) → Possibly a recovery day from a busy week. Wednesday also has relatively high sleep (7.00 hours).

• Monday and Friday have lower sleep averages (6.25 hours) → May indicate workweek stress or late-night activities.

• Tuesday has the lowest average sleep (6.2 hours).

Sleep duration fluctuates slightly, with Sundays showing the most rest and midweek (Tuesday) showing the least. This could be due to busy schedules and stress affecting sleep on workdays.

### 2. Bellabeat Users’ Hourly Step Activity Trends

• Step activity is lowest from midnight to early morning (0:00 - 5:00 AM) → Expected as this is typical sleep time. Step count starts rising from 6:00 AM and peaks between 12:00 PM - 6:00 PM.

• Highest activity occurs at 6:00 PM (599.2 steps), followed by 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM (540-550 steps).

• Activity declines after 6:00 PM, with a sharp drop after 8:00 PM.

Users are most active in the afternoon and early evening but become less active as the day progresses, especially at night.

### 3. Correlation Between Sleep & Step Activity

• Longer sleep on Sundays might lead to lower morning activity, but overall step counts remain steady throughout the day.

• Lower sleep on weekdays (Monday, Tuesday) could impact energy levels, possibly affecting activity levels.

• Peak step hours (12 PM - 6 PM) align with midday breaks and post-work exercise routines. Drop in activity after 8 PM suggests users might be winding down for rest.
