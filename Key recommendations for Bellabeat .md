2.  Encourage Evening Walks & Nighttime Movement Push notification example: "Take a quick evening walk to boost your step count & relax before bed!"

3.  Weekend Activity Boost Since weekends (especially Sundays) have lower steps, launch a “Weekend Warrior” challenge encouraging users to stay active.

## 2. Optimize Sleep & Recovery

3.  Encourage Post-Sleep Morning Movement Since users sleep longer on Sundays, encourage morning yoga or stretching routines to start the day actively.

## Boost Caloric Burn & Activity Throughout the Week

1.  Targeted Workout Recommendations Monday Motivation Campaign: Encourage users to keep Monday’s momentum going throughout the week.

Friday Recovery Workouts (low-impact stretching, yoga) to help users stay engaged without feeling fatigued.

2.  Integrate Caloric Burn Goals with Step Tracking Since step activity and caloric burn are linked, Bellabeat should suggest step-based calorie goals. Example: "You’re 1,500 steps away from burning an extra 200 kcal today. Let’s go!
